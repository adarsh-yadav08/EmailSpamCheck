# Email Spam Detection

This project is an email spam detection system built using Python and machine learning techniques. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze and classify emails as spam or not spam.

## Features
- **Spam Classification**: Classifies emails into spam or non-spam categories based on their content.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes algorithms like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to build the classification model.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Implements text preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
- **Evaluation**: Performance evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
